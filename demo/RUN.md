# Compile ArrayList.ll
To compile the ArrayList.ll file you need to have compiled the llCompiler. You can find a guide in the `README.md`.
The following command compiles the ArrayList.ll file:
```bash
./llCompiler -c ./ArrayList.ll
```

For this to work the llCompiler binary and the ArrayList.ll file have to be in the same directory. Otherwise you habe to specify relative or absolute paths to the corresponding file.
